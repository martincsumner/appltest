 sftp -i ./src/main/resources/.ssh/arcadiams  marftp@192.168.168.66




 Just a quick note to say thanks for your help…

 Turned out to be an issue within the underlying library that does the SSH/SFTP rsa auth.

 I had come to the fix you gave me on my own as well - but I kept getting a bad key exception. - and that threw me off the scent.

 I had ssh-keygen ‘d created a pair of keys.

 Added them to the remote host, tested the connection from the command line — all good.

 Then picking up the private key and running from within camel == boom + bad key exception ?!


 Cut an afternoon of teeth knashing short:
 ===============================

 -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
 b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAABFwAAAAdzc2gtcn

 Is how the key becomes generated from a straight keygen as above (which works from the command line perfectly).

 But you have to do keygen -t rsa -m PEM

 then you get a header that looks like this:

 -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
 MIIEogIBAAKCAQEA4aGquf7h5ZKLtMSVrFaBa1EIXQ85

 …and this one works!!! — without the "-m PEM” it does not work.

 f. sake I am too old for this shit - and this was just the easy bit the real climb is still in front of me.

 Do you reckon this is worth blogging for the next lost soul who stumbles into this?
 ...Or is this common knowledge for all the people that do this professionally?
